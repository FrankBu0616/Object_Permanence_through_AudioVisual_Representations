## Object_Permanence_through_AudioVisual_Representations

This is the repository accompanying the paper submission Object_Permanence_through_AudioVisual_Representations. In this work, we proposed a multimodal neural network model, using partially observed trajectory and audio, to predict the trajectory and final position of a dropped object.

Dataset is available at https://intuitivecomputing.jhu.edu/openscience.html

Pretrained weights for combined model is provided in multimodal_pretrained_weights.pkl.

partition.txt provides a dictionary of indices we used for training, validation, and testing.
